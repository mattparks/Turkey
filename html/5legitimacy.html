      There is a legitimacy from the constitution and elections; however, there have been Electoral fraud allegations weakining the legitimicy to the government.
      The “yes” vote in the constitutional referendum has replaced the long-standing parliamentary system with a presidential one that allows the president to simultaneously lead a political party in the parliament.
      The "yes" vote also allsows the executive branch to have complete immunity from parliamentary oversight of cabinet and bureaucratic appointments. The president can be prosecuted only if a supermajority of members of the parliament approves.
      Because the vote passed there is still some legitimacy, but the aftermath of the voting might cause this to fall.
      Erdogan has increased Islamic influence on the government, sprking protests that are being cracked down on, how long will this regime last before a coup?
