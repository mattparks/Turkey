  <p><b>Trend Arrow:</b> "Turkey received a downward trend arrow due to renewed violence between the government and Kurdish militants, terrorist attacks by the Islamic State group, and intense harassment of opposition members and media outlets by the government and its supporters ahead of November parliamentary elections."</p>
  <br/>
  <p><b>Political Rights:</b> 24 / 40</p>
  <p>"Freedom of expression is constitutionally guaranteed, and some media outlets are critical of the government. However, in recent years dozens of intellectuals and journalists have been jailed, particularly on terrorism charges."</p>
  <br/>
  <p><b>Civil Liberties:</b> 29 / 60</p>
  <p>"Freedoms of association and assembly are protected in the constitution, and Turkey has an active civil society. Protests and public gatherings on a range of issues were held without incident during 2015, though others were broken up by security forces, particularly in the southeast, and terrorist bombings added a new risk to public assemblies. In April 2015, ErdoÄŸan signed legislation that increased criminal penalties for various actions during protests and empowered police to fire on demonstrators who use incendiaries."</p>
